This section focuses on 'let' and 'const'. These are new declarations in ES6 that allows us define variables in different ways compared to the old var method.
'let' is set replace 'var' and is to replace block level scope. This means if we declare a variable in the global scope and we redeclare that same variable in a loop or an if statement its going to be completely different, i.e on its own scope.
