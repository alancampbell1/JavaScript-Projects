JavaScript ES6:

ECMAScript, aka the latest version of JavaScript, is a scripting language standard and specification. JavaScript is based on the ECMAScript standard.

ES6 is the most recent version of ECMAScript/ JavaScript. This is the first major update since 2009 with ES5 and there has been many changes.

Goals of ES6:
- Make JavaScript be taken more seriously. JavaScript was sometimes not considered the best option.
- Fixed issues from ES5, bugs etc.
- Backward compatibility
- Modern syntax
- Better scaling and for big applications. JavaScript is now being used for big apps for big companies.
- Add new features, using classes without typescript

Compatibility with modern browsers:
- Chrome and Firefox nearly there but need work.
- ES6 has transpires that can used to compile ES6 code into ES5. This can be done using Babel (a JS Compiler) and must be considered when deploying as a website accessible from different browsers.

What's new?
- 'let' and 'const' declarations: 'let' is a replacement for 'var' but gives you block scope local variables. For example, with 'let' we can limit the scope of a variable to function or a loop etc. 'const' is for constant, i.e the variable does not change.

- Destructuring Assignment - helps us extract data from Arrays and Objects into distinct variables

- Classes and Inheritance - we no longer have to use prototyped based objects we can standard classes and we can extend and inherit them.

- Template Strings - replaces concatenation, we can use `` instead of ''. We can include variables and bind data.

- String Features

- Math & Number Features

- New Data Structures - e.g. Map and Set

- Iterators

- Generators - functions that can be paused and yield a value and continue as needed.

- Promises & Asynchronous Data

- Arrow Functions
