This project will focus on Asynchronous JavaScript. Covering 'Callbacks', 'Promises' and the 'Async-Await' syntax.
These are all ways to deal with asynchronous data. Asynchronous refers to when something is going on but you do not want to wait until that thing is done to continue your program. You want to continue while it is happening.
The opposite is synchronous programming where something happens and you wait until it is completely finish before moving onto the next thing.
Asynchronous programming is very relevant to JavaScript because we are often making requests to servers and it can take a couple seconds to get your data back and you might not want your program to stall in the meantime.

'Callbacks' were the traditional method to achieve asynchronous programming until ES6 introduced 'Promises'. Promises give you a more elegant way of dealing with asynchronous
data.
In ES7, Async-Await was introduced which deals with 'Promises' but dealing with the response in a way thats more elegant. It looks more like synchronous programming.
