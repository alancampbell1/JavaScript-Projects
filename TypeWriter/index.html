<!--

The HTML is very basic for this project. 
The main tag to focus on is the span tag in the container div tag.
With HTML 5 we can add custom data attributes and then access them in the JavaScript.
data-wait is set to 3000 milliseconds which is the wait period after the custom
attribute is printed.
data-words will be passed as a String but our JavaScript will use JSON.parse to access
each word as an element in an Array.
